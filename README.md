# 🍉 Suika Game (Watermelon Game) – Raylib C++

A faithful **Suika (Watermelon) Game clone** built using **C++ and Raylib**.  
The game follows the original Suika rules: click to drop fruits, merge identical fruits to create bigger ones, and avoid overflowing the container.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay Rules

- Click anywhere inside the container to **drop a fruit**
- Only **one fruit can fall at a time**
- Fruits merge **only when two identical fruits collide**
- Merging creates a **bigger fruit**
- Score increases **once per merge**
- Game ends when a **settled fruit crosses the top danger line**
- The **next fruit preview** is shown on the top-right

This implementation avoids common bugs like:
- Negative score overflow
- Multiple merges per frame
- Fruits disappearing incorrectly
